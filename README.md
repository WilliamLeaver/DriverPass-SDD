# System-Design-Doc
System Design Document and Business Requirements Document created for CS-255
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
-The Driverpass project followed the design of a system for the client DriverPass. This client wanted a system that would allow users to connect with instructors that --would teach them the skill required to pass the drivers license exams. 
What did you do particularly well?
- I feel that my Buisness Requirements Document was the stornger part of the project. Using all of the information and interviews provided I put together an extensive background of the requirements put forth by DriverPass.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would revise the use case UML and the class UML to have more detail. I feel that especially the class UML could have been a lot more descriptive in order to be more useful to the dev team.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- In order to understand what the user needed I did a combination of market research into other systems that have similiar functionality, and also the features that the client was requesting. It is important to consider the user's needs because in order for the system to be successful any user should be able to use it.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- The best way to approach designing software is to go into the project ready to keep notes and make sure you know what the client is looking for the system to do, and the experience that they want to provide to the users. In order to do this a good strategy would be to regularly compare what you have with what is desired that way you do not miss any features when building the software.
